This Fully Associative Cache module, written in Verilog, implements a high-performance caching mechanism with fully associative mapping, allowing any memory block to be stored in any cache line. It features write-allocate and write-back policies to optimize memory writes and reduce latency, along with an LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement strategy for efficient cache management. The design is fully synchronous, ensuring reliable operation in clocked environments, and is parameterized, allowing customization of cache size, block size, address width, and data width. This module is ideal for use in custom CPU designs, embedded systems, and high-speed memory architectures, providing enhanced performance through intelligent data storage and retrieval.
